Wordlists
=========

The passphrases generated by `diceware` naturally depend on the set of
words used, the wordlists.

`diceware` comes with some wordlists out-of-the-box, that might be a
good choice for usual private use.

By default we use the so-called `8k wordlist`_ from Mr. Reinhold as
published on http://diceware.com/. It contains 8,192 english words
and phrases.

.. warning:: We do *not* use the `diceware standard wordlist`_ (which
	     contains 7,776 words) by default, because computers
	     prefer powers of two and we use the Python standard lib
	     random source by default.

	     But this "original" list is included in diceware as
	     well. You can pick it with the ``-w en_orig`` option and
	     you *should* pick it when you use real dice as source of
	     randomness.

You can pick another list with the ``-w`` or ``--wordlist`` option.

You can add own wordlists.

You can add PGP-signed wordlists.
