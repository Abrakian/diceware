Wordlists
=========

The passphrases generated by `diceware` naturally depend on the set of
words used, the wordlists.

`diceware` comes with some wordlists out-of-the-box, that might be a
good choice for usual private use.

By default we use the so-called `8k wordlist`_ from Mr. Reinhold as
published on http://diceware.com/. It contains 8,192 english words
and phrases.

.. warning:: We do -- by default -- *not* use the `diceware standard
	     wordlist`_ (which contains 7,776 words), because
	     computers prefer powers of two and we use the Python
	     standard lib random source by default (we do not want to
	     waste entropy).

	     But the "original" list is included in diceware as well
	     and you can pick it with the ``-w en_orig`` option.  You
	     *should* pick it when you use real dice as source of
	     randomness.

You can pick another list with the ``-w`` or ``--wordlist`` option.


Add Own Wordlists
-----------------

The wordlists we offer for use with `diceware` are all stored in a
single folder. The exact location is output by ``--help`` at the very
end::

  $ diceware --help
  ...
  Wordlists are stored in /some/path/to/folder

Just put your own wordlists into this folder (here:
``/some/path/to/folder``) and rename the file to something like
``wordlist_MY_SPECIAL_NAME.txt``. Afterwards you can pick your
wordlist by running::

  $ diceware -w MY_SPECIAL_NAME

`diceware` will use this file of yours then to create a
passphrase. Please note that `diceware` only accepts files that are
named like::

  wordlist_NAME.txt

or::

  wordlist_OTHER_NAME.asc

I.e. we expect ``wordlist_`` at the beginning and some filename
extension like ``.txt`` at the end. Furthermore names must not contain
funny characters. In fact we accept regular letters, dashes, numbers,
and underscores only. Files that do not follow these naming convention
are ignored.

A list of all available wordlist names can also be retrieved with
``--help``. See the ``--wordlist`` explanation.


Special Wordlists
-----------------

Out of the box, `diceware` supports PGP-signed wordlists and numbered
wordlists. Numbered wordlists contain numbers in each line, telling a
sequence of dice rolls.
