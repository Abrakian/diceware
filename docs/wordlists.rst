Wordlists
=========

The passphrases generated by `diceware` naturally depend on the set of
words used, the wordlists. `diceware` comes with some wordlists
out-of-the-box, that are a good choice for usual private use.

By default we use the so-called ``8k`` list from http://diceware.com/
with 8,192 english words.

.. warn:: We do *not* use the list for use with dice (which contains
	  7,776 words) by default, because the computer is better at
	  binary math and we use the Python standard lib random source
	  by default.

	  But the "original" list from http://diceware.com/ is
	  included in diceware as well. You can pick it with the ``-w
	  en_orig`` option.

You can pick another list with the ``-w`` or ``--wordlist`` option.

You can add own wordlists.

You can add PGP-signed wordlists.
